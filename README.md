# DUKPT
This Python module implements DUKPT encryption/decryption based on the DUKPT (Derived Unique Key Per Transaction) scheme using 3DES (Triple DES) algorithms. The implementation is inspired by the vanilla JavaScript implementation of IDTech DUKPT encryption/decryption.


## Description
Derived Unique Key Per Transaction (DUKPT) is a key management scheme widely used in payment processing and secure data transmission. This Python module seamlessly integrates the DUKPT scheme, employing the strength of 3DES algorithms to ensure robust security for transactional data.

The DUKPT implementation provided here is designed to match the standards set by the IDTech DUKPT encryption/decryption in JavaScript. This ensures compatibility and consistency for projects that may involve cross-language implementations.


## Note
This implementation supports Python 3.
